        time at university, I actively engaged in various extracurricular
        activities and projects, which helped me develop essential skills such
        as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving.

        eager to learn and grow both personally and professionally. As a
        fresher, I understand the importance of gaining practical experience and
        learning from experienced professionals. I am confident that I will be a
        valuable addition to any team, as I bring a fresh perspective,
